Maas, this young adult fantasy follows the forbidden romance between a powerful prince and an ordinary girl as they try to survive their kingdom?s grueling laws pitting them against each other.She is the very thing he?s spent his whole life hunting.  He is the very thing she?s spent her whole live pretending to be. Only the extraordinary belong in the kingdom of Ilya?the exceptional, the empowered, the Elites. The powers these Elites have possessed for decades were graciously gifted to them by the Plague, though not all were fortunate enough to both survive the sickness and reap the reward. Those born Ordinary are just that?ordinary. And when the king decreed that all Ordinaries be banished to preserve his Elite society, lacking an ability suddenly became a crime?making Paedyn Gray a felon by fate and a thief by necessity. </p>
